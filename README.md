This repo is where all the versions (from 1.0.2 on) of Stock Simulator by cheeseburg5R2024 on Scratch are uploaded for archiving purpose!
Stock Simulator is a (surprise, surprise!) simulator of the stock market. The game can be found at https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/1240802055/ or https://turbowarp.org/1240802055?hqpen&interpolate on Turbowarp.
Copying the game is allowed if you plan to expand the project's code or the project (unless you just reskin the game), and you have to use an ORIGINAL THUMBNAIL. If you also plan to borrow some code to base a game on, that's fine with me!
